PHP Debug Mode Enabler
======================

> not only for Nette Tracy

Safe and clean way to automatize Nette Debug mode at specific environment (Docker for example).

Installation
------------
```bash
composer require redbitcz/debug-mode-enabler
```

Using
-----
In `bootstrap.php` wrap first parameter in `setDebugMode([])` function like this:
```php
$configurator->setDebugMode(DebugEnabler::isDebug([], __DIR__ . '/temp'));
```

In your devstack set for PHP process environment `NETTE_DEBUG=1`. For example in Docker composer file:
```yaml
environment:
    NETTE_DEBUG: 1
```

Danger zone
-----------
If know what do you do, you can call `DebugEnabler:turnOn()` to enable Debug mode for your browser. **This is very danger, use it carefully!**

Advanced
--------
You can choose `Env` or `Token` detection method only instead of automatic detection.

Detection by Environment only:
```php
DebugEnabler::isDebugByEnv([])
```

Detection by Token (and cookie) only:
```php
DebugEnabler::isDebugByToken([])
```

What's the magic `[]`?\
It's used as return value when no Debug mode is detected and it's move decision to automatic rule
in Nette Debugger. Use `false` if you want to prevent transfer of detect mode to Debugger.

Is set `workDir` required?\
Yes if you want to use detect by Token (cookie).
